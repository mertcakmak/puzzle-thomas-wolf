## PUZZLE: THOMAS and THE WOLF

This is a technical interview question. It has been built by using NextJS [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

You will see the main game data in the `[data]` folder. You can add a new layout or edit the existing one. We have only 2 sample games. You can use the 'Greate New Game' module and play on your onw game. If you want to store your own games you have to put them into the /data/gameData.json file.
